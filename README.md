# Raspberry Pi 4 SSD Case

![](images/pi4_0.jpg)

# Summary
I created this case so I could easily attach an SSD to my Raspberry Pi 4. It's perfect for using the Raspberry Pi as a media center, a server, or a desktop PC.

You will need M3 mounting screws to attach the SSD to the case. (I found some of these screws included with my PC case.)

I created this case by combining and modifying the remixed sources in Tinkercad. I filled in some of the cutouts on the top of the case, and the unnecessary ventilation on the sides. I also cut out ventilation in the bottom of the case and room for the M3 screws. I had to also cut out some space for the Micro HDMI cables.

I really wanted to find a case like this here on Thingiverse but since I couldn't find a case that had what I needed, I decided to create the exact case myself.

I hope that this case will work well for anyone who needs it. I highly recommend it.

If you're interested in modifying the case you can get started with the model on Tinkercad:
